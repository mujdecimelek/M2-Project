# M2 Project: Sales Strategy

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the Module 2 project focused on developing a sales strategy based on the analysis of a given dataset. The goal is to identify the reasons behind a decline in sales data and to enhance customer satisfaction.

## Marketing Strategy Recommendation
Based on our analysis, we've developed a marketing strategy that leverages customer segmentation and product category analysis to understand the varying interests of different customer groups. This helps us tailor our marketing efforts to be more effective.

### Recommendations and Action Steps
To address the needs of distinct customer segments, we propose the following strategies:

1. **Targeted Advertising and Content Marketing:**
   - Use digital advertising and social media campaigns to promote Beauty and Clothing products to young customers.
   - Engage middle-aged customers with electronics and clothing through content marketing and discount campaigns.

2. **Personalized Promotions and Loyalty Programs:**
   - Introduce segment-specific discounts and promotions to foster customer loyalty.
   - Offer special discounts or gift cards for new Beauty and Clothing products to young customers and implement loyalty programs for electronics and clothing for middle-aged customers.

## Dataset Analysis
The dataset used in this project has been instrumental in providing insights into customer behaviors and sales trends. The detailed analysis can be found within the Jupyter Notebook, where we explore the data to draw meaningful conclusions for our sales strategy.
